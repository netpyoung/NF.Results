![NF.Results](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/netpyoung/NF.Results/master/icon/Icon.png)

NF.Results contains rust likes option/result type for C#.

* Version: 1.0.1

## What's this?
I want to use `Result`, `Option` type likes rust.
at first I tried to [Optional](https://github.com/nlkl/Optional).
but, It's not suitable for me. so I written this code.

## The fast track
* `nuget install NF.Results`

## Example
