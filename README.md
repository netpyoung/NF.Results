![NF.Results](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/netpyoung/NF.Results/master/icon/Logo.png)

NF.Results is a robust option/maybe type for C#.

Version: 1.0.0

## What's this?
I want to use `Result`, `Option` type likes rust.
at first I tried to [Optional](https://github.com/nlkl/Optional).
but, It's not suitable for me. so I written this code.

## The fast track
* `nuget install NF.Results`

## Example
